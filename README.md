## Hey, Hi, Howdy

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for game development and teaching.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Art that I own! For the first time in my life I live near a popular convention center and I am taking complete advantage. I buy a lot of nerdy posters, paintings, portraits, I even have a few 3D pieces. I take a photoshoot after a convention and love sharing them with people
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a world record run for [Antz Extreme Racing (GBA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGz7kTy21qg) I stole this record to create a rivalry with a friend. I'll die with this record


## Teaching
My first experience teaching computer science was with [iD Tech](https://www.idtech.com/), first as a summer instructor, and then a lead instrutor the following year. I taught campers from 13-18 in python, java, and c++. Not to brag, but I was dang darn good at instructing. So good in fact that I decided to continue into the school year. I signed up as a remote instructor with [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/) my sophmore year, tutoring highschool and college students for the next 5 years.

If I could create proper stablility through tutoring, I'd still be teaching. Most of my students were early year college students that had a python coarse they needed help surviving ðŸ˜† It was an interesting challenge to help students who had no interest in software break down problems in the way we need to for computer science. It felt very similar to when your first learning algebra and all of a sudden your math has word problems in it. I had many students who felt endlessly frustrated because the same thing had happened with their computers. Going from using word and power point to C++ and python. And TOO OFTEN I had students who could understand the purpose and function of variables, conditions, loops, but having no idea when or where to use it to solve an assignment. I charged over 60 an hour for most of my time teaching so I always recommended going to professors and TA's but most students told me they get 15 minutes a week for questions and help. I had one student going through nursing school and their compsci professor brought them to tears over a homework assignment ðŸ˜­

My other students simply needed additional explanation. My busiest subject by leagues was Data Structures I  & II. Most professors completely fail to give any connection between how things work and WHY we use them. Combined with poorly written assignments and people will pay seamingly anything for someone to paitently guide them through an assignment. I miss helping students get to those major aha moments.


## Game Development
I'm bad at this! ðŸ¤£ I've really only just begun my dev journey and I hit plenty of roadbumps. At first I played around with several game engines, GameMaker Studio, then Godot, then Unity, then Unity did their really crummy licenscing, and back to Godot for version 4 ðŸ˜µ Each time needing to relearn simple aspects that I had forgotten and or needed to do a bit differently. I've often struggled with making sure rigidbody works properly with its object family. To be honest since these are passion projects I often follow that passion where ever it goes. I often think of a feature I want to try and replicate, and once I get a bare bones MVP I move onto a new feature.

I am officially enjoying Godot and have worked out general flows for making and importing models/textures, have simple Node Trees for basic ojects. I'm hoping to start pushing more polished final projects ðŸ¤™
