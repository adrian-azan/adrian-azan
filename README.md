## Hey, Hi, Howdy

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for game development.

## Teaching
My first experience teaching computer science was with [iD Tech](https://www.idtech.com/), first as a summer instructor, and then a lead instrutor the following year. I taught campers from 13-18 in python, java, and c++. Not to brag, but I was dang darn good at instructing. So good in fact that I decided to continue into the school year. I signed up as a remote instructor with [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/) my sophmore year, tutoring highschool and college students for the next 5 years.
